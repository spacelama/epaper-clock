# epaper-clock
Motorcycle epaper clock that should update display once a minute, including time with automatic timezone update, NTP time syncing when connected to a wifi (perhaps eventually Bluetooth on your phone), temperature, and when ignition is on, will be backlit when too dark to read.  Othewise with ignition off, will run off LiIon battery and go into deep sleep for a minute at a time

When mounting your epaper display, remember epaper is susceptible to UV light, and your bike may be outside in the sun 12 hours a day, so find a case with some UV blocking glass on front to put your clock in (and let me know where you sourced such a thing from).
